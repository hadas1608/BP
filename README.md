I worked on an Ubuntu 14.04 with Python 2.7.6, docker and docker-compose.
In order to run the script, please add the following files to the root directory of your app repository:
dep_flow.py
docker-compose.yml
then, run: python dep_flow.py
note: I haven't performed any change in any of the files in your repository in order to make it work.
